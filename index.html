My current role as Supply Chain Planner (part-time) involves coordinating multiple tasks: liaison with Shippers, International Freight Forwarders and Customs Brokers in order to facilitate cargo movements to all major ports around the globe, monitor end to end production, liaison with supplier, manage inventory and member of product innovation team. </p>
  <p>Moreover, in my previous job I have worked as a customer service officer with a Melbourne based company, where I communicated with customers daily basis, invoicing, providing the quotation, allocating technicians and vehicles. </P>
  <p>At the moment I think an ideal and suitable job according to my current experience and education could be Supply and Demand planner. </p>
